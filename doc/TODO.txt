now:
- get to a running C++ program that throws exceptions instead of printing errors
	and exiting.
- add "make run" targets to the makefile so that I would not have to do "sudo make install"
	to run my demos.

doxygen:
- add doxygen support for this project.
- add master (long) documentation to doxygen.
- publicize the documentation for this somewhere (wiki on github ?!?).

website:
- do a website for this project.

library:
- find out how to call a function with all the arguments passed to me...
- wrap more functions.
- do more tests.
