The major dilemma:
- do we want people to add #include to except.h or not?
Advantages:
- we could emit the line/function/file that had the problem.
Disadvantages:
- The user needs to change her/his source code and recompile.
Problems:
- how do we overload the ioctl (or any other function) for that matter?

Ideal:
- have both. The user could include and then would get the extra info
or he could avoid inclusion and use linking or runtime linking and get
just error messages.
